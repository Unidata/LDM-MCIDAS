.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program is an LDM decoder for McIDAS data of type \fBGRID\fP:
it reads a McIDAS data grid from standard input or from a file
and decodes that data in the manner of the McIDAS \fBGUNRV2\fP action.
.LP
This program can be invoked by an entry in an LDM
configuration file similar to the following:
.sp
.RS
.ta \w'MCIDAS   'u
.nf
MCIDAS	^(GUNRV2 .*)
	PIPE
	-close /usr/local/ldm/bin/gunrv2
.fi
.RE
.LP
Additional, profusely-annotated examples of LDM5 pqact.conf entries can be
found in the file ldm-mcidas-pqact.conf in the \fBetc/\fP subdirectory of the 
ldm-mcidas installation tree.
.fi
.RE
.LP
Since this program reads from standard input, it can also be invoked as a
stand-alone program, outside the LDM environment.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-d " datadir
Change to directory \fIdatadir\fP before decoding.  As a consequence, the
output file will appear in that directory and the \fBROUTE.SYS\fP and
\fBSYSKEY.TAB\fP files will be looked for and, if found, used, and updated
in that directory.  Note that \fBROUTE.SYS\fP and \fBSYSKEY.TAB\fP must be
both readable and writable by the user running \fBgunrv2\fP.
.TP
.BI "-f " path
Read from file \fIpath\fP rather than from standard input.
.TP
.BI "-F " path
Read from file \fIpath\fP rather than from standard input.  At exit, delete
the file.
.TP
.BI "-l " logpath
Log file pathname.
The program uses Unidata's \fBulog\fP(3) package to write error and diagnostic
messages.
The default is to write to the \fBsyslogd\fP(8) daemon.  If this option is
specified, however, then messages will be written to the file
\fIlogpath\fP unless that pathname is "-", in which case all messages will be
written to standard error.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose logging.
Informative messages (level LOG_INFO) are logged.
By default, only messages of severity LOG_NOTICE and greater are
logged.  See the Unidata LDM Site Manager's Guide for more information on 
message logging.
.TP
.B -x
Debug logging.
Debugging messages (level LOG_DEBUG) are logged. See the Unidata LDM Site 
Manager's Guide for more information on message logging.
.SH NOTES
.LP
Unidata recommends that the following McIDAS-X routing table update commands
be use to setup \fBROUTE.SYS\fP entries used by \fBgunrv2\fP (for more 
information see the section on \fBROUTE\fP in the McIDAS-X Users Guide):

.nf
ROUTE ADD NG GRID   1   2 CC=3 SYS=2031 2032 2033 PP=ADDGRID.BAT "Early Domestic Products
ROUTE ADD NF GRID 101 102 CC=3 SYS=2034 2035 2036 PP=GLOBAL.BAT "Global Initialization Grids
ROUTE REL NG NF
.fi

\fBROUTE.SYS\fP will be used by \fBgunrv2\fP if it exists in the directory
in which \fBgunrv2\fP creates its output \fBGRID\fP files (see \fB-d\fP flag above)
and is both readable and writable by the user running \fBgunrv2\fP.

\fBSYSKEY.TAB\fP entries specified by the \fBSYS=\fP keywords listed above
will be updated if \fBSYSKEY.TAB\fP exists in the directory in which
\fBgunrv2\fP creates its output \fBGRID\fP files (see \fB-d\fP flag above) and
is both readable and writable by the user running \fBgunrv2\fP.
