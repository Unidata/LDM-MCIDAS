.SH DESCRIPTION
.LP
This program is an LDM decoder for McIDAS data of type \fBMD\fP:
it reads a McIDAS netCDF data product from a file
and decodes that data into a McIDAS \fBMD\fP file.
.LP
This program can be invoked by entries in an LDM configuration file
similar to the following:
.sp
.RS
.ta 8n +8n +8n
.nf
MCIDAS  ^(LWFILE PROFILER.CDF)
	PIPE
	-close lwfile
	-l /usr/local/ldm/logs/ldm-mcidas.log -v
	-d /var/data/mcidasd

MCIDAS	^(LWFILE) (PROFILER.CDF) .* DIALPROD=(..)
	EXEC
	cdftomd 
	-l /usr/local/ldm/logs/ldm-mcidas.log -v
	-d /var/data/mcidasd  \\3 \\2 81
.fi
.RE
.LP
The first action tells the \fBLDM\fP to file the product received
(\fBPROFILER.CDF\fP).  The
second action executes \fBcdftomd\fP on the file just written.  The order
of these two invocations is critical: the product \fBmust\fP be filed before
\fBcdftomd\fP can be run successfully.  \fBcdftomd\fP can not be run from
data piped to its standard input since netCDFs are, by nature, random
access files.
.LP
Additional, profusely-annotated examples of LDM5 pqact.conf entries can be
found in the file ldm-mcidas-pqact.conf in the \fBetc/\fP subdirectory of the 
ldm-mcidas installation tree.
.fi

.LP
This program can also be invoked as a stand-alone program, outside the
\fBLDM\fP environment.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI "-d " datadir
Change to directory \fIdatadir\fP before decoding.  As a consequence, the
output file will appear in that directory and the \fBROUTE.SYS\fP and
\fBSYSKEY.TAB\fP files will be looked for and, if found, used, and updated
in that directory.  
.TP
.BI "-l " logpath
Log file pathname.
The program uses Unidata's \fBulog\fP(3) package to write error and diagnostic
messages.
The default is to write to the \fBsyslogd\fP(8) daemon.  If this option is
specified, however, then messages will be written to the file
\fIlogpath\fP unless that pathname is "-", in which case all messages will be
written to standard error.
.TP
.B -v
Verbose logging.
Informative messages (level LOG_INFO) are logged.
By default, only messages of severity LOG_NOTICE and greater are
logged. See the Unidata  LDM Site  Manager's  Guide  for more information on 
message logging.
.TP
.B -x
Debug logging.
Debugging messages (level LOG_DEBUG) are logged. See the Unidata  LDM Site  
Manager's  Guide  for more information on message logging.
.SH NOTES
.LP
Unidata recommends that the following McIDAS-X routing table update command
be use to setup \fBROUTE.SYS\fP entries used by \fBcdftomd\fP (for more 
information see the section on \fBROUTE\fP in the McIDAS-X Users Guide):

.nf
ROUTE ADD U4 TEXT X X PROFILER.CDF CC=3 SYS=2041 2042 2043 PP=PROFILER.BAT "FSL Wind profiler
ROUTE REL U4
.fi

The McIDAS schema file, \fBSCHEMA\fP, must exist in the directory into
which \fBcdftomd\fP creates data files and be readable by the user
running \fBcdftomd\fP. \fBcdftomd\fP reads information about the form
of the output \fBMD\fP file from \fBSCHEMA\fP.

\fBROUTE.SYS\fP and \fBSYSKEY.TAB\fP must be readable and writable by
the user running \fBcdftomd\fP.  

\fBROUTE.SYS\fP will be used by \fBcdftomd\fP if it exists in the
directory in which \fBcdftomd\fP creates its output \fBMD\fP files (see
\fB-d\fP flag above) and if it is both readable and writable by the
user running the \fBcdftomd\fP.

\fBSYSKEY.TAB\fP entries specified by the \fBSYS=\fP keyword listed above
will be updated if \fBSYSKEY.TAB\fP exists in the directory in which
\fBcdftomd\fP creates its output \fBMD\fP files (see \fB-d\fP flag above) and
is both readable and writable by the user running \fBcdftomd\fP.
