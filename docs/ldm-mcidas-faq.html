    <h2>LDM-McIDAS FAQs</h2>
    <h3>String Searchable Email Archive</h3>
    <p>Unidata archives all email inquiries regarding the LDM-McIDAS package. One of the quickest ways to solve
      problems you may be having is to search this archive and see if others have had the same or similar problems.
      Use the dialogue box to enter the keyword(s) that relate to the problem you are having.</p>
    <p>For example, if you received the following message while <b>make</b> was trying to compile <b>lwtoa3</b>:</p>
    <pre>
      ld: Undefined symbol
    </pre>
    <p>You could search the archive with the keyword sequence: <b>make lwtoa3</b>.  This would search all the messages
      and return a list of those that contained both the words <b><i>make</i></b> followed by <b><i>lwtoa3</i></b>.</p>
    <p>Multiple keywords will cause records containing the phrase to be returned.  Multiple keywords separated by commas
      and no spaces will cause records containing any of the keywords to be returned.  Multiple keywords separated by
      semi-colons will cause records containing the keywords to be returned.</p>
    <p>In this example, after reading through the messages that contained those the phrase <b>make lwtoa3</b>, you would
      most likely find that you need to build the McIDAS-X libraries before building the LDM-McIDAS decoders.</p>

    <h3 id="10">General Information</h3>
    <h4 id="11">What is the LDM-McIDAS package?</h4>
    <p>LDM-McIDAS is a set of LDM-compatible programs for decoding the McIDAS products from the Unidata-Wisconsin
      (McIDAS) data stream.  A detailed list of the functions of these programs can be found
      <a href="ldm-mcidas-what.html">here</a>.</p>

    <h4 id="12">Why would I want to use the LDM-McIDAS programs?</h4>
    <p>The LDM-MCIDAS decoders are the easiest way to convert <b>f0</b> packetized products in the Unidata-Wisconsin
      datastream into data files that are readily usable by McIDAS (and GEMPAK for imagery).</p>
