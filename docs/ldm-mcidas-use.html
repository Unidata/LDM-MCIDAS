    <h2>Configuring the LDM to Run the Decoders</h2>
    <p>Even though they can run "by hand", <b>LDM-MCIDAS</b> decoders are typically run as actions of the <b>LDM</b>'s
      <b>pqact</b> utility.</p>
    <p>Five decoders, <b>pnga2area</b> and <b>pngg2gini</b>, <b>nldn2md</b>, <b>proftomd</b>, and <b>zlibg2gini</b>, are
      used to decode PNG-compressed <b>MCIDAS</b> (Unidata-Wisconsin) and <b>FNEXRAD</b> imagery, <b>NLDN</b> lightning
      data from SUNY Albany, <b>FSL2</b> Wind Profiler data, and Zlib-compressed NOAAPORT GINI imagery, respectively.
      Decoded imagery is usable in all Unidata supported application packages (i.e., GEMPAK, McIDAS, and IDV);
      non-imagery products are decoded into McIDAS-compatible formats.</p>
    <p>Additional decoders included in the LDM-McIDAS distribution do not work on current datastream products, but
      continue to be included for sites that have archives of Unidata-Wisconsin products included in the IDD before July
      of 1999.</p>
    <p><b>cdftomd</b>, <b>nids2area</b>, <b>gunrv2</b>, <b>lwfile</b>, <b>lwtmd2</b>, and <b>lwtoa3</b> decode FSL Wind 
      Profiler, WSI NIDS, and pre-2000 Unidata-Wisconsin datastream products into McIDAS format data files. 
      <b>gunrv2</b>, <b>lwfile</b>, and <b>lwtmd2</b>'s use was obsoleted by the removal of GRID, TEXT, and MD files 
      from the Unidata-Wisconsin datastream on July 1, 1999.  <b>lwtoa3</b>'s use was obsoleted by the switch to use of 
      PNG-compressed images in the Unidata-Wisconsin datastream in August of 2000.  <b>cdftomd</b>'s use was obsoleted 
      by the introduction of <b>proftomd</b>.  <b>nids2area</b> can still be run to create McIDAS AREA files from 
      uncompressed WSI-format NIDS products, but it is recommended that sites receiving WSI NIDS or IDD NEXRAD Level III 
      products use the McIDAS-X 7.8+ NEXRAD LEVEL III ADDE server to access these data files instead.</p>
    <p>After the LDM-McIDAS decoders are installed, you need to configure your LDM <b>pqact.conf</b> file to run the 
      LDM-McIDAS decoders that you want to use.  Annotated example <b>pqact.conf</b> entries for the decoders can be 
      found in <a href=ldm-mcidas-pqact.conf.all.html>LDM Pattern-Action File for LDM-MCIDAS Decoders</a>. A stripped 
      down version of this file suitable for inclusion in the LDM's <b>pqact.conf</b> file is available in 
      <a href="ldm-mcidas-pqact.conf.all">ldm-mcidas-pqact.conf.all</a>. To transfer this to your machine, hold down the 
      Shift key while pressing mouse button 1 over the link.</p>
    <p>The <a href="ldm-mcidas-pqact.conf.all">ldm-mcidas-pqact.conf.all</a> entries were written assuming that you want 
      to decode data into the following directories:</p>

    <table class="simple">
      <tr>
        <td><b>Application</b></td>
        <td><b>Output Data Directory</b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>GEMPAK</b></td>
        <td><b>~ldm/data/gempak</b></td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td><b>McIDAS</b></td>
        <td><b>~ldm/data/mcidas</b></td>
      </tr>
    </table>
    <p>If you are using these same directory structures, configuring your LDM <b>pqact.conf</b> file should be as simple
      as copying the <a href="ldm-mcidas-pqact.conf.all">ldm-mcidas-pqact.conf.all</a> entries you want to use into
      <b>~ldm/etc/pqact.conf</b>, verifying the integrity of <b>pqact.conf</b>, and then sending a <b>HUP</b> signal to
      your LDM's <b>pqact</b> process (this assumes you are running reasonably current versions of the LDM; if you are
      not, please contact Unidata User Support for help).</p>
    <p>Type the following:</p>
    <pre>
      <b>cd ~ldm/etc</b>
    </pre>
    <p>Edit <b>pqact.conf</b> and add entries from ldm-mcidas-pqact.conf.all.  Then type:</p>
    <pre>
      <b>ldmadmin pqactcheck</b>
    </pre>
    <p>Correct any errors in <b>pqact.conf</b>, and then type:</p>
    <pre>
      <b>ldmadmin pqactHUP</b>
    </pre>
    <p><b>NOTES:</b></p>
    <ul>
      <li><b>LDM-MCIDAS</b> decoders are designed to work on one product at a time. It is important, therefore, to
        include the <b>-close</b> option on pqact lines for each <b>LDM-MCIDAS</b> decoder.</li>
      <li>The PNG AREA file encoder (compressor), <b>area2png</b> and PNG compressed AREA file decoder (uncompressor),
        <b>pnga2area</b> require information from the McIDAS satellite annotation, <b>SATANNOT</b>, and satellite band
        description, <b>SATBAND</b>, files.  Copies of these files should be placed in a directory whose location will
        be used in the <b>LDM</b>'s pattern-action file, <b>pqact.conf</b>.  We recommend the <b>~ldm/etc</b> directory
        for this purpose.
        <p>The information needed by the decoders is as follows:</p>
        <table class="simple">
          <tr>
            <td><b>Encoder/Decoder</b></td>
            <td><b>McIDAS Information Files</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>area2png</b></td>
            <td><b>SATANNOT, SATBAND</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>pnga2area</b></td>
            <td><b>SATANNOT, SATBAND</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>pngg2gini</b></td>
            <td><b>none</b></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
      </li>
      <li>Several <b>LDM-MCIDAS</b> decoders require information contained in the McIDAS schema file, <b>SCHEMA</b>.
        <b>SCHEMA</b> is distributed with both <b>LDM-McIDAS</b> and <b>McIDAS-X</b>.
        <p>The information needed by the decoders is as follows:</p>
        <table class="simple">
          <tr>
            <td><b>Decoder</b></td>
            <td><b>Schema</b></td>
            <td><b>Schema Template File(s)</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>cdftomd</b></td>
            <td><b>WPRO</b></td>
            <td><b>DCWPRO</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>nldn2md</b></td>
            <td><b>NLDN</b></td>
            <td><b>DCNLDN</b></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><b>proftomd</b></td>
            <td><b>WPRO, WPR6</b></td>
            <td><b>DCWPRO, DCWPR6</b> </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>In McIDAS, schema are <i>registered</i> in <b>SCHEMA</b> using the <b>SCHE</b> command and an appropriate
          schema template file.  The <b>McIDAS-X</b> invocation examples will register the NLDN (<b>NLDN</b>), FSL
          hourly summary profiler (<b>WRPO</b>), and FSL 6-minute profiler schema (<b>WPR6</b>) in <b>SCHEMA</b>:</p>
        <pre>
          <b>SCHE DCNLDN</b>
          <b>SCHE DCWPRO</b>
          <b>SCHE DCWPR6</b>
        </pre>
        <p>A copy of <b>SCHEMA</b> with appropriate entries for the output file types needs to be placed in the
          directory in which the <b>LDM-McIDAS</b> decoders create their output data files.</p>
        <p><b>SCHEMA</b> must be readable AND writable by the user running the LDM and <b>LDM-MCIDAS</b> decoders.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>LDM-MCIDAS</b> image decoders can use McIDAS file routing concepts. To enable the use of McIDAS file routing,
        you MUST use a routing table, <b>ROUTE.SYS</b>, that has been created by McIDAS-X, and it MUST be copied to the
        directory into which the decoders create output data files.  A copy of <b>ROUTE.SYS</b> configured to support
        decoding of imagery conveyed in the IDD is included both in Unidata McIDAS-X and in LDM-McIDAS.
        <p><b>ROUTE.SYS</b> must be readable AND writable by the user running the LDM and <b>LDM-MCIDAS</b>
          decoders.</p>
      </li>
      <li><b>LDM-MCIDAS</b> decoders can also update the McIDAS System Key Table, <b>SYSKEY.TAB</b>, with information
        about data received.  In order to have <b>SYSKEY.TAB</b> updated automatically upon receipt of new products, it
        MUST exist in the directory in which decoders create output data files.  A copy of <b>SYSKEY.TAB</b> is included
        both in Unidata McIDAS-X and in LDM-McIDAS.
        <p><b>SYSKEY.TAB</b> must be readable and writable by the user running the LDM and <b>LDM-MCIDAS</b> decoders.</p>
      </li>
      <li>Since it is <b>strongly</b> recommended to not configure the <b>ldm</b> account with knowledge of McIDAS
        processes, there is no direct way to have <b>LDM-MCIDAS</b> decoders execute McIDAS ROUTE PostProcess BATCH
        files.  Unidata has, however, developed a procedure that allows sites running the LDM and McIDAS-X to execute
        ROUTE PostProcess BATCH commands upon the receipt of data products in the Unidata-Wisconsin stream.  Detailed
        information on setting up your system to do this is found in the <a href="ldm-mcidas.routepp">README.PP</a> file
        in the src/decoders subdirectory of the LDM-MCIDAS distribution.</li>
