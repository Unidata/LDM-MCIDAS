<h3>String Searchable Email Archive</h3>
</a>

Unidata archives all email inquiries regarding the LDM-McIDAS package.
One of the quickest ways to solve problems you may be having 
is to search this archive and see if others have had the same or 
similiar problems.  Use the dialogue box to enter the keyword(s) that relate
to the problem you are having.<p>

For example, if you received the following message while <b>make</b>
was trying to compile <b>lwtoa3</b>:

<pre>
         ld: Undefined symbol
</pre>

you could search the archive with the keyword sequence: <b>make
lwtoa3</b>.  This would search all the messages and return a list of
those that contained both the words <b><em>make</em></b> followed by
<b><em>lwtoa3</em></b>.<p>

Multiple keywords will cause records containing the phrase to be
returned.  Multiple keywords separated by commas and no spaces will
cause records containing any of the keywords to be returned.  Multiple
keywords separated by semi-colons will cause records containing all of
the keywords to be returned.<p>

In this example, after reading through the messages that contained
those the phrase <b>make lwtoa3</b>, you would most likely find that
you need to build the McIDAS-X libraries before building the LDM-McIDAS
decoders.<p>
