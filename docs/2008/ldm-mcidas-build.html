<h2>Building and Installing the LDM-McIDAS decoders</h2>

If there is no binary distribution that will work on your machine, you
will need to build the LDM-McIDAS decoders from source.

<p>
After you download the source distribution of the LDM-McIDAS
package, you need to move it to a suitable location, compile,
test, and install the software.<p>

<h3>Where to Install the Software</h3>
</a>

Like all Unidata packages, LDM-McIDAS is distributed as a separate package,
and you can build and install it any place
you like on the machine that is running the <b>LDM</b> so long as the
user running the <b>LDM</b> has access to and execute privilege for its
decoders.

<p>
Here are some guidelines for LDM-McIDAS:<p>

<ul>
   <li>we recommend that you build/install in the same account that you use
       for the LDM package (e.g., <b>ldm</b>).<p>

   <li>if you decide to not build/install LDM-McIDAS in the <b>ldm</b>
       account, we recommend that you install it at the same level as the LDM
       (e.g., /usr/local/ldm-mcidas if the LDM is installed in
       /usr/local/ldm).
</ul>

<p>
If you follow these guidelines, your directory structure would look
something like:

<p>
To build the source distribution or unpack the binary distribution in the
<b>ldm</b> account, you would move the compressed tar
file to the <b>/usr/local/ldm/ldm-mcidas</b> directory and uncompress and
untar the file:

<pre>
   &lt;login as the user <b>ldm</b>&gt;

   <nobr>Type: <b>mkdir ldm-mcidas</b></nobr>
   <nobr>Type: <b>cd ldm-mcidas</b></nobr>
   <nobr>Type: <b>mv </b>&lt;<em>ldm-mcidas_download_directory</em>&gt;<b>/ldm-mcidas-2004.tar.Z .</b></nobr>
   <nobr>Type: <b>zcat ldm-mcidas-2004.tar.Z | tar xvf -</b></nobr>
</pre>

<p>
If you are working with a binary distribution, you can proceed to the

<h3>What to do Before Compiling</h3>
</a>

<ol>

<li><h3>Defining Environment Variables</h3>

LDM-McIDAS uses the <b><em>configure</em></b> utility to create C
header and compilation Makefile files.  The packages that LDM-McIDAS
decoders depend on are:

<p>
<ul>
   <li>Unidata LDM<br>
   <li>Unidata McIDAS-X<br>
   <li>Unidata netCDF (bundled wth McIDAS-X)
   <li>zlib (bundled with LDM-McIDAS)
   <li>libpng (bundled with LDM-McIDAS)
</ul>

<p>
If both the <b>LDM</b> or <b>McIDAS-X</b> are installed in
&quot;standard&quot; directories,
<b><em>configure</em></b> will correctly guess values for
needed, system-dependent environment variables.  If those packages are not
installed in &quot;standard&quot; directories, you will need to define
environment variables that will tell <b><em>configure</em></b> where to
find the packages.

<p>
The easiest way to insure that <b><em>configure</em></b> will find all
of the packages it needs is to define needed environment variables
yourself.  The full set of environment variables you may need to define
to build LDM-MCIDAS are:

<!--
You should read the McIDAS-X
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/mcidas/2004/mcx/backup/warnings_mcx.html#netcdf">Notes and Warnings</a>
section on setting environment variables needed for
building the <b>netCDF</b> package bundled with McIDAS-X.  You will
need to define the same environment variables to build LDM-McIDAS as for the
<b>netCDF</b>.

<p>
In addition to the environment variables listed in
<a href="http://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/mcidas/2004/mcx/backup/warnings_mcx.html#netcdf">Notes and Warnings</a>,
you should also define the following:
-->

<p>
<table border=1>

<tr>
<td>Environment variable</td>
<td>Use</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CC</td>
<td>C compiler to use</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CFLAGS</td>
<td>C compiler flags to use</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CPPFLAGS</td>
<td>C preprocessor flags to use</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>FC</td>
<td>Fortran compiler to use</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>FFLAGS</td>
<td>Fortran compiler flags to use</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CPP_LDM</td>
<td>Compile-time reference for LDM header files</td>

<tr>
<td>LD_LDM</td>
<td>Link-time reference for LDM library</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td>CPP_MCIDAS</td>

<td>Link-time reference for X11 library</td>
</tr>

<tr>

<td>Link-time reference for math library</td>
</tr>

</table>

<p>
Example environment variable settings for a Linux system:

<pre>
CC=gcc
CFLAGS=-O
CPPFLAGS='-DNDEBUG -Df2cFortran'
FC=g77
FFLAGS='-O -Wuninitialized -fno-automatic -ff90-intrinsics-hide'
CPP_LDM=-I/home/ldm/include
LD_LDM='-L/home/ldm/lib -lldm'
CPP_MCIDAS=-I/home/mcidas/inc
LD_MCIDAS='-L/home/mcidas/lib -lmcidas'
CPP_NETCDF=-I/home/mcidas/include
LD_NETCDF='-L/home/mcidas/lib -lnetcdf'
LD_X11=-L/usr/X11R6/lib -lX11
LD_MATH=-lm
</pre>

<!--
<pre>
   Type: <b>setenv CPP_MCIDAS '-I/home/mcidas/inc</b>'
   Type: <b>setenv LD_MCIDAS  '-L/home/mcidas/lib -lmcidas'</b>
   Type: <b>setenv CPP_NETCDF '-I/home/mcidas/mcidas2006/netcdf/libsrc'</b>
   Type: <b>setenv LD_NETCDF  '-L/home/mcidas/mcidas2006/netcdf/libsrc -lnetcdf'</b>
</pre>
-->

<p>
After defining the environment variables, you should go into the <em>src</em>
directory of the LDM-McIDAS version you just unpacked:

<pre>
   Type: <b>cd ~ldm/ldm-mcidas/ldm-mcidas-200<em>x</em>/src</b>
</pre>

<p>
and read the <b>README</b> and <b>INSTALL</b> files before proceeding.
<b>INSTALL</b> provides additional information on running the configuration
utility.

<p>
<li><h3>Running <em>configure</em></h3>

<p>
The next step is to run the <b><em>configure</em></b> shell script
located in the <em>src</em> directory of the LDM-McIDAS version tree:

<pre>
   Type: <b>./confgure</b>
</pre>

</ol>

<p>
<hr>
<a name=compile>
<h3>Compiling the Software</h3>
</a>

Once <b><em>configure</em></b> has run, and assuming it ran with no errors,
you use <b>make</b> to compile, test and install the LDM-McIDAS package.

<p>
There are 3 steps in the <b>make</b> process:

<p>
<ol>
   <li><b>creation of libraries and executables</b> - where the source code is
       compiled and the libraries are created
   <li><b>installation</b> - where the binaries and libraries are moved to 
       the directories you specified when you ran <em>configure</em>
   <li><b>cleaning up</b> - where the object files are deleted
</ol>

To build, install, and then cleanup, you can type:

<p>
For `csh'-compatible shells:

<pre>
    Type: <b>make all install clean >&! ldm-mcidas.log &</b>
    Type: <b>tail -f ldm-mcidas.log</b>
</pre>

<p>
For POSIX.2-compatible shells (e.g `sh', `ksh', `bash:

<pre>
    Type: <b>make all install clean >ldm-mcidas.log 2>&1 &</b>
    Type: <b>tail -f ldm-mcidas.log</b>
</pre>

<p>
Following these examples, output from the make command will be sent to the file
<b><em>ldm-mcidas.log</em></b>.  The tail command allows you to view
the output as it is sent to the log file.  We recommend that you send
the output to a log file.  If there are problems, and you can't figure
out what is wrong, you can mail the log file to
<A HREF="mailto:support-ldm-mcidas@unidata.ucar.edu">&lt;support-ldm-mcidas AT unidata.ucar.edu&gt;</A>.

<p>
<hr>
<a name=install>
<h3>Installing the Software</h3>
</a>

<p>
At this point, you could use the LDM-McIDAS decoders from the directory
you just installed them in:
<b>~ldm/ldm-mcidas/ldm-mcidas-200x/bin</b>.  We recommend, however, that you copy
them to the either the <b>~ldm/decoders</b> or <b>~ldm/util</b> directory and
use them from there.  Which directory you copy them to will depend on which
directory you have previously created and included in the <b>PATH</b> for the
user running your LDM.

<p>
Since the most commonly used directory for LDM decoders is
<b>~ldm/decoders</b>, we recommend that copy them there:

<pre>
   &lt;while still logged in as 'ldm'&gt;
   Type: <b>cd ~ldm/ldm-mcidas/ldm-mcidas-200<em>x</em>/bin</b>
   Type: <b>chmod +x *</b>
   Type: <b>cp area2png ~ldm/decoders</b>
   Type: <b>cp nldn2md ~ldm/decoders</b>
   Type: <b>cp pnga2area ~ldm/decoders</b>
   Type: <b>cp pngg2gini ~ldm/decoders</b>
   Type: <b>cp proftomd ~ldm/decoders</b>
   Type: <b>cp zlibg2gini ~ldm/decoders</b>
</pre>

<p>
If this is a first-time installation for the LDM-McIDAS decoders on your
system, also do the following (do not do this if you are upgrading):

<pre>
   Type: <b>cp batch.k ~ldm/decoders</b>
   Type: <b>cp uwgrid.sh ~ldm/decoders</b>
</pre>

<p>
Next, if you will be using <b>pnga2area</b> to decode <b>MCIDAS</b> and
<b>FNEXRAD</b> datastream imagery into McIDAS usable formats, you will
need to copy two files in the LDM-McIDAS <b>etc</b> to the
<b>~ldm/etc</b> directory:

<pre>
   &lt;while still logged in as 'ldm'&gt;
   Type: <b>cd ~ldm/ldm-mcidas/ldm-mcidas-200<em>x</em>/etc</b>
   Type: <b>cp SATANNOT ~ldm/etc</b>
   Type: <b>cp SATBAND ~ldm/etc</b>
</pre>

<p>
If you will be decoding <b>FSL2</b> Wind Profiler and <b>NLDN</b> lightning
data into McIDAS compatible data files, you must copy three files
in the LDM-McIDAS <b>etc</b> to the to the directory where you want
decoders for these data to write their output:

<pre>
   &lt;still logged in as 'ldm'&gt;
   Type: <b>cd ~ldm/ldm-mcidas/ldm-mcidas-200<em>x</em>/etc</b>
   Type: <b>chmod 664 ROUTE.SYS SYSKEY.TAB</b>
   Type: <b>chmod 666 SCHEMA</b>
   Type: <b>cp ROUTE.SYS ~ldm/data/mcidas</b>
   Type: <b>cp SYSKEY.TAB ~ldm/data/mcidas</b>
   Type: <b>cp SCHEMA ~ldm/data/mcidas</b>
</pre>

<p>

<h3>Diagnosing problems and other considerations</h3>
</a>

If an error occurs during the <b><i>configure</i></b> or <b>make</b>
process, you can try to diagnose the problem by looking at the file
<b>config.status</b> or by looking at the <b>make</b> log file.<p>

If you are unable to figure out what is wrong, send a message to
<A HREF="mailto:support-ldm-mcidas@unidata.ucar.edu">&lt;support-ldm-mcidas AT unidata.ucar.edu&gt;</A>.<br>
and include (if possible) the error message (ex: the output from the log
file).  A few of the common problems that occur and a brief description are
listed below.  A more complete listing of common problems (and solutions) can
be found
by searching the
<a href=ldm-mcidas-faq.html#mail>LDM-McIDAS email archive</a>.<p>

<ul>
   <li><b>When doing a <i>make</i>, make bombs when it tries to
       compile the decoders</b>- You probably have not installed the McIDAS-X,
       LDM, or netCDF libraries or include files or the path to any of them
       is incorrect.<p>

   <li><b>You get the error <i>Cannot load command</i> followed by a
       reference to a GEMPAK directory</b> - The <b>AR</b> environment variable
       is set as a reference to the location of the GEMPAK AREA files.
       Set this variable to nothing (<b>setenv AR</b>) and rerun configure.
</ul>

<B>REMEMBER:</b> You need to have the <a href=/software/ldm/index.html>LDM</a>,
<a href=/software/netcdf/index.html>netCDF</a>, and McIDAS-X libraries
and include files installed on your system before you can build the
LDM-McIDAS decoders.<p>
